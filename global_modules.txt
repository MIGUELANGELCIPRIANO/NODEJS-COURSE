It is possible to install a dependency globally on your computer to work with it in multiple projects using the command 'npm i -g', for example:

npm i -g nodemon

In this case, nodemon would be installed as a global dependency on your computer and should not be installed as an internal dependency within your project.
Just run the command directly in our console. 
However, consider that if such a project is uploaded to a remote repository, it would be better to clarify, in the documentation for any other user,
the need to install the dependency before running the project. 
Or to avoid this inconvenience, simply install it internally within the project like any other dependency.
